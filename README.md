# Container Desktop

Container Desktop is an open-source alternative to Docker Desktop. It enables you to build, push, pull and run Linux containers on Microsoft Windows, by providing a seamless integration with Docker Engine Community Edition running on Windows Subsystem for Linux. The Container Desktop bundles the open-source docker and docker-compose cli clients for a native and simple user experience.
## How it works?

![](docs/static/img/container-desktop-overview.png)

Container Desktop Proxy handles the communication with the Docker Engine running in container-desktop distribution within Windows System Linux v2 (WSL2). The proxy enables native docker experience on Microsoft Windows, where it translates Windows Paths to WSL2 paths local to the container-desktop distribution.

With the Container Desktop System Tray Application you can manage the behavior of container-desktop. You can start, stop and restart the Container Desktop Proxy on the Windows Host or Enable or Disable a Docker Engine proxy in any available WSL2 distribution.
Container Desktop installs the docker and the docker-compose command line interface tools.

> Note: Container Desktop will not support Windows Containers.

## Supported features

The solution is in its early days and supports the following features:

* Run Docker daemon in its own distribution
* Use 'docker' and 'docker-compose' cli on Windows to connect to the daemon
* You can use Windows paths as volumes, the container-desktop-proxy translates these paths to WSL2 paths local to the daemon distribution
* Start/stop/restart and quit Container Desktop by right clicking on the icon in the system tray.
* Enable container-desktop integration in installed WSL2 distributions.

## Installation

**System requirements**

Container Desktop requires WLS2 which is supported on these Windows versions:

* Microsoft Windows 10, Version 1903 with Build 18362.1049 or higher
* Microsoft Windows 10, Version 1909 with Build 18363.1049 or higher
* Microsoft Windows 10, Version 2004 or higher (20H2,21H1, 21H2, ..)
* Microsoft Windows 11, any version or build

**Installation Steps**

1. If you currently have docker-desktop installed, you need to **quit** *"Docker Desktop"*.
2. Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/container-desktop/container-desktop/releases)
3. (optional) Validate the file checksum  with the values in sha256sum.txt

    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash .\ContainerDesktopInstaller.exe -Algorithm SHA256
    ```

3. StartContainerDesktopInstaller.exe and click install to start the installation.

> Note: Windows Defender SmartScreen may pop-up and prevent StartContainerDesktopInstaller.exe from starting. When this is the case do the following: please select "More Info" and Select "Run Anyway".
