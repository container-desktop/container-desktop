Microsoft Windows 11, any version or build WSL2 requires Virtualization Extensions (Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V) to be enabled in the BIOS of a the physical machine or on configuration your Virtual Machine. More details on how to enable Virtualization Extensions on you favorite Windows desktop virtualization products: Hyper-V VirtualBox VMware Workstation If you currently have docker-desktop installed, you either need to quit Docker Desktop if you want to try-out Container Desktop or uninstall / remove Docker Desktop if you are convinced that Container Desktop is a proper replacement. Container desktop can be installed next to docker-dekstop is only cannot be active at the same time as they both use the same named-pipe interface for the clients to connect to (the docker-cli and docker-compose cli). Install and run Container Desktop \u00b6 Download the latest ContainerDesktopInstaller from GitHub releases. (optional) you can validate the file checksum with the values in sha256sum.txt with the PowerShell command: Get-FileHash .\\ ContainerDesktopInstaller . exe -Algorithm SHA256 Double-click ContainerDesktopInstaller.exe to run the installer.

Port Forwarding feature \u00b6 Container Desktop provides a feature to expose containers on a specific network. By default, no containers are only accessible on the localmachine (localhost) and not from any other network interface. With the Port forwarding feature you can bind the container ports to a specific network interface. This allows other network clients to access the running containers. As a user you need to configure the firewall to allow inbound traffic to the containers. Example Scenario \u00b6 In this example scenario we are going to publish an nxing container on HTTP/80 on an external network interface. The example scenario contains the following steps Run nginx container on Port 80 Enable Port forwarding in COntainer Desktop Configure the Windows Firewall Run nginx container on port 80 \u00b6 First, we run an nginx container with the -p argument to publish it on port 80, for example: docker run -p 80:80 -d nginx By default, Container Desktop makes whatever is running on port 80 in the container available on port 80 of localhost (in this case nginx). This meens only connections to localhost:80 are sent to port 80 in the container, and it is not accesible from any other network interface. Note: In this example, the host and container ports are the same. In the example port 80 is used if this port is allready in use you can specify a different external port, for exampl docker run -p 8000:80 -d nginx (here port 8080 is used). Open your browser and open http://localhost, the default \u201cWelcome to nginx!\u201d page should be shown. Enable Port Forwarding \u00b6 Now we can pusblish the running containers, in this case nginx on port 80, to a specific network interface. Select the Port forwarding _ option in the Container Desktop system tray application, and select the network interface that you want to use: Container Desktop binds the adapter to listen to the container ports that are published. Configure firewall \u00b6 To allow external connections we need to open the firewall to accept inbound traffic on the used ports. Open PowerShell with administrator privileges Create a new Firewall inbound rule to accept inbound traffic on port 80 New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Container-Desktop-Example\" -Direction Inbound -Profile Private -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 80 Note: In this example the firewall profile \u201cPrivate\u201d is used.
